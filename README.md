# Final Portfolio

## Description

This project is a final portfolio designed to showcase my work done during the IMD course, the portfolio was developed as a company I named Echo Studio. The website includes several pages highlighting work in web design, graphic design and UX/UI.

## Development Process

The development of this portfolio involved several important stages:

1. **Planning and Design:**
    - Research and analysis of existing portfolios for inspiration.
    - Creation of wireframes and high-fidelity designs using Figma.
    - Definition of site structure and navigation.

2. **Development:**
    - Setting up the development environment with HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5.
    - Implementation of a responsive design to ensure the site looks good on devices of all sizes.
    - Integration of animations and visual effects using CSS and Spline 3D.

3. **Testing and Adjustments:**
    - Extensive testing on different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
    - Adjustments based on user feedback and usability testing.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenges:
- **Browser Compatibility:** Ensuring the site looks and functions consistently across all major browsers.
- **Responsive Design:** Creating a design that adapts well to different screen sizes without losing functionality or aesthetics.
- **Load Optimization:** Maintaining fast load times despite using high-quality images and animations.

### Solutions:
- **Browser Compatibility:** Utilizing tools like BrowserStack to test across different browsers and fix specific issues.
- **Responsive Design:** Using Bootstrap 5 to leverage its responsive grid system and flexible design utilities.
- **Load Optimization:** Compressing images and using lazy loading to load images only when needed.
